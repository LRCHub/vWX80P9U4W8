There's a world of trouble on my mind
Tell me everything will work out fine
I'll believe you
They've knocked me to the ground again
Tell me what I'm feeling isn't pain
I'll believe you
I wish I could be sure of more than I am now my friend

I lost my needle in the hay
Tell me I will find it again someday
I'll believe
If love is not my greatest defence
Tell me nothing's ever meant to make much sense
I'll believe you
